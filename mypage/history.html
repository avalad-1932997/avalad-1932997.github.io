						<h1>History</h1>
						<p>Where did Twenty One Pilots begin?</p>
					</header>
					<a href="https://www.twentyonepilots.com/" class="image fit"><img src="images/evo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Originally founded as a trio in 2009 during Tyler Joseph’s time Ohio State University, the band would reject the names Chill Coat and Bicycle Thief before settling on the moniker Twenty One Pilots, based on the Arthur Miller play, All My Sons. The following two years would see the trio go their separate ways, 
						with the previous drummer inviting Josh Dun to take his place and thus, forming the Twenty One Pilots duo we know today. Dun and Joseph would take a guerilla approach with the band in the year to come, aggressively touring the Columbus Ohio area to the point where they were able to sell out the iconic Columbus’
						 Newport Music hall without any label backing. This, of course, would lead to the record label Fueled By Ramen taking notice of the duo’s steadily growing fan base and adding them to their roster in 2012 alongside artists such as Paramore and Panic! At The Disco.</p>
					<p>The following section of Twenty One Pilot’s story reads like it was played at ten times speed, as the coming years would see the band grow from cult Ohio hit to international sensation. Working with Greg Wells, who was known for producing hits for Adele and Katy Perry,
						 the band would release their first full-length studio album, 2013’s Vessel. The album would land itself on US’ Billboard 200, UK’s OCC, and fourteen other countries’ weekly charts. An indisputably phenomenal breakout entry into the music world at large, Twenty One Pilots had officially emerged and caught both 
						 ours and the world’s eyes. The remainder of the year would see the band fully hitting its stride. Following the release of Vessel, the duo made their late night debut on Conan, 
						had two viral hits with “House of Gold” and “Car Radio,” and we geared up to present their 2013 autumn tour.</p>

						<p>As the band continued on tour and Vessel grew with age, two things became readily apparent about Twenty One Pilots as a band. The duo had an irrefutable talent for both delivering electrically charged live shows and crafting high-energy and moving albums that never failed to contain at least one standout hit, 
							“Car Radio” and “House of Gold” serving as prime examples of the latter on Vessel. The former would play into the band’s exponentially growing fan base, as word quickly traveled that a Twenty One Pilots show was an experience not to miss. Fans apparently weren’t the only ones to share and spread the sentiment, 
							with the duo booked to play nearly every festival imaginable in 2014. This festival takeover only led to even more requests from cities for a
							 proper Twenty One Pilots show of their own, which led to band’s first headlining tour, the Quiet is Violent World Tour.
							 At the time, it would have been seemingly impossible to imagine that this small local Ohio band who had experienced such rapid growth in a matter of three years would go on to reach even higher summits, yet that is exactly what happened. 2015 would see the release of Twenty One Pilot’s most successful album to date, Blurryface.
							 The time in between the release of Blurryface and the subsequent years where the duo was showered with awards and praise would also see the release of “Heathens,” the leading single from the Suicide Squad Soundtrack and catalyst to one the duo’s most noticeable achievements to date. </p>
							 <p>Beyond all the accolades, universal praise, and accompanying fame, Blurryface and the release of the radio hit single “Heathens” had cemented Twenty One Pilots as a band that had officially made music history. The band will forever go down as the third rock band in history to have two charting singles in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, 
								 preceded only by Elvis Presley and The Beatles. Despite the band’s worldwide level of fame and making music history all in the matter of a short few years, the duo has never for a second forgotten their roots. In June 2017, the band announced the Tour de Columbus, a series of five shows in their hometown of Columbus, Ohio, including the Newport 
								 Music Hall where it all began. In their hearts, Twenty One Pilots will always be the local Ohio band that gave every ounce of their being 
								 to those hometown shows that started it all. This without a doubt, shows in their newest album: Trench. </p>
